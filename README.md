Dota Runtime Tracker is a program that will track the time that dota (or any other process on your machine) is running.

If you want to set it up, you can use the Windows automated tasks to put the program on Autostart.

It will check every few seconds if the program is running and if it is, it will track the time you spent having it open.

After tracking the time it will be saved in a txt file that will track the entire amount of time you have opened it so far.
